  This has details of 5 vulnerabilities or CVEs reported for openssh package in
  RHEL 9 in last one year. RHEL AI is expected to use this document and generate
  sample question and answers for other vulnerabilities
seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      SSH stands for Secure SHell and is a program for logging into remote
      system securely and also allows file transfer operations. This has several
      authentication mechanism supported. OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the
      last free version of SSH. The openssh is package shipped on RHEL 9.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is SSH ?
        answer: >-
          SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing
          commands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and
          rsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two
          untrusted hosts over an insecure network.
      - question: What is OpenSSH ?
        answer: >-
          OpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing
          it up to date in terms of security and features. This package includes
          the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and server.
      - question: What packages are available with openssh ?
        answer: >-
          There are mainly 3 packages : openssh, openssh-server and
          openssh-clients. You can list using rpm command 'rpm -qa | grep
          openssh'.
  - context: >-
      There are several CVEs reported for openssh. We will target only 5 CVEs
      here including, CVE-2023-48795, CVE-2023-51385, CVE-2024-6387,
      CVE-2024-6409 and CVE-2024-7589.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What CVEs related to openssh are known to you as per fine-tuning ?
        answer: >-
          As of 6th March 2025, I am fine-tuned with details of following 5 CVEs
          related to openssh package on RHEL 9.
          CVE-2023-48795
          CVE-2023-51385
          CVE-2024-6387
          CVE-2024-6409
          CVE-2024-7589
      - question: >-
          For which package vulnerabilities CVE-2023-48795, CVE-2023-51385,
          CVE-2024-6387, CVE-2024-6409 and CVE-2024-7589 are reported ?
        answer: These vulnerabilities are related to openssh package on RHEL system. 
      - question: Are vulnerabilities related to openssh important ?
        answer: >-
          Yes, vulnerabilities related to openssh package are important as it
          involves secure login to the systems, and if its affected, there is
          high risk of unauthorized access to the secure system.
  - context: >
      The vulnerability or CVE-2023-48795 is also referred to as terrapin
      attack. This affects openssh packages on RHEL. A flaw was found in the SSH
      channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake,
      an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without
      causing a MAC failure.

      - question: What is CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          Vulnerability reported for openssh package on RHEL. A flaw was found
          in the SSH channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during
          the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the
          secure channel without causing a MAC failure.
      - question: |
          What is impact of CVE-2023-48795 or terrapin attack vulnerability ?
        answer: >-
          The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to
          delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
          begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke
          timing obfuscation features.
      - question: What is mitigation for CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          You can disable affected ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8
          and RHEL-9. You can apply a subpolicy to disable CHACHA20-POLY1305
          cipher and set ssh_etm=0.
  - context: >-
      An update for openssh is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 as
      RHSA-2024:1130 which fixes two vulnerabilities CVE-2023-48795 and
      CVE-2023-51385. The fix is included in version 8.7p1-34.el9_3.3.x86_64 of
      openssh.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Which package version includes fix for CVE-2023-48795 and
          CVE-2023-51385 ?
        answer: >-
          Fix for CVE-2023-48795 and CVE-2023-51385 is released as
          RHSA-2024:1130 on 5th March 2024. For details on fix refer errata link
          https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1130. You must have this or
          higher package version to fix the vulnerability.
      - question: What is the state of CVE-2023-48795 for openssh component ?
        answer: >-
          CVE-2023-48795 has state as 'Fixed' with errata as RHSA-2024:1130. You
          are requested to apply this errata on the system using dnf command
          'dnf update openssh*'.
      - question: What CVEs are fixed by RHSA-2024:1130 ?
        answer: >-
          CVEs fixed by RHSA-2024:1130 includes following two CVEs :
          CVE-2023-48795 CVE-2023-51385
  - context: >-
      SSH is mainly affected by configuration vulnerabilities which includes :
      Weak Key Exchange Algorithms, CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled, Insecure HMAC
      Algorithms and Terrapin Attack, which can be fixed by updating
      configuration for MACs, Ciphers and KexAlgorithms for sshd server.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How to fix vulnerability 'CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled' for openssh ?
        answer: |-
          To remove the CBC algorithm using sub-policy.
          $ vi /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/DISABLE-CBC.pmod
          ssh_cipher = -AES-128-CBC -AES-256-CBC
          Then update policy to include sub-policy.
          $ sudo update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT:DISABLE-CBC
      - question: How to list all supported parameters in sshd ? 
        answer: >-
          To list all supported ciphers by ssh server, there are two alternatives as below :
          1. Using nmap : $ nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos -sV -p 22 127.0.0.1
          2. Using sshd command utility : $ sshd -T | egrep "cipher|mac|kexalgorithm"
      - question: How to apply new or sub-policy using cryptographic policy in RHEL ?
        answer: >-
          Define sub-policy and add parameters.
          Then apply sub-policy using command similar to below.
          $ sudo update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies
          --show):sub-policy-name-here-in-capitals
