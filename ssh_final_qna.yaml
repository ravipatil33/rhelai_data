  - context: >
      The vulnerability or CVE-2023-48795 is also referred to as terrapin attack. 
      CVE-2023-48795 affects openssh packages on RHEL. A flaw was found in the SSH channel integrity. 
      By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without causing a MAC failure. 
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          Vulnerability reported for openssh package on RHEL. A flaw was found
          in the SSH channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during
          the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the
          secure channel without causing a MAC failure.
      - question: |
          What is impact of CVE-2023-48795 or terrapin attack vulnerability ?
        answer: >-
          The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to
          delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
          begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke
          timing obfuscation features.
      - question: What is solution for CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          To fix vulnerability CVE-2023-48795, update the openssh package to version 8.7p1-34.el9_3.3.x86_64 using $ dnf update openssh.
  - context: >-
      CVE-2023-51385 affects openssh packages on RHEL. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands by using expansion tokens, such as %u or %h. 
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What is statement for CVE-2023-51385 ?
        answer: >-
          The ability to execute OS commands is dependent on what quoting is present in the user-supplied ssh_config directive. However, it is generally the users responsibility to validate arguments passed to SSH.
      - question: What is the mitigation for CVE-2023-51385 ?
        answer: >-
          Mitigation for CVE-2023-51385 either not available or the currently available.
      - question: How to fix vulnerability CVE-2023-51385 ?
        answer: >-
          To fix vulnerability, update the openssh package to version 8.7p1-34.el9_3.3.x86_64. 
          $ dnf update openssh
  - context: >-
      CVE-2024-6387 affects openssh packages on RHEL. A security regression (CVE-2006-5051) was discovered in OpenSSH's server (sshd).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Explain CVE-2024-6387 briefly ?
        answer: |-
          A security regression (CVE-2006-5051) was discovered in OpenSSH server (sshd). There is a race condition which can lead sshd to handle some signals in an unsafe manner. An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to trigger it by failing to authenticate within a set time period.
      - question: What RHEL versions are affected by CVE-2024-6387 ?
        answer: >-
          RHEL 9 is the only affected version. RHEL 6, 7, and 8 all utilize an older version of OpenSSH which was never affected by this vulnerability.
      - question: List steps to mitigate CVE-2024-6387 on RHEL 9 ?  
        answer: >-
          1. As root user, open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config. 
          2. Add or edit the parameter configuration:
                $ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                  LoginGraceTime 0
          3) Save and close the file
          4) Restart the sshd daemon:
                $ systemctl restart sshd.service
  - context: >-
      CVE-2024-6409 affects openssh packages on RHEL. A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH server (sshd)
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Can you describe CVE-2024-6409 ?
        answer: >-
          A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.
      - question: Does CVE-2024-6409 affects upstream versions of sshd ?
        answer: >-
          CVE-2024-6409 vulnerability only affects the versions of OpenSSH shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. Upstream versions of sshd are not impacted by this flaw.
      - question: What is solution to fix vulnerability CVE-2024-6409 ?
        answer: >-
          To fix vulnerability, update openssh package to version 8.7p1-38.el9_4.4.x86_64 or higher. If already on higher version, you are not affected by the vulnerability. 
          $ dnf update openssh
  - context: >-
      CVE-2024-7589 does not affect openssh packages on RHEL. CVE-2024-7589 vulnerability is specific to the FreeBSD distribution of OpenSSH.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What is description for CVE-2024-7589 ?
        answer: >-
          A signal handler in sshd(8) may call a logging function that is not async-signal-safe. The signal handler is invoked when a client does not authenticate within the LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default). A race condition exists that a determined attacker may be able to exploit to allow an unauthenticated remote code execution as root.
      - question: Is CVE-2024-7589 affecting Red Hat Products ?
        answer: >-
          CVE-2024-7589 vulnerability is specific to the FreeBSD distribution of OpenSSH. Red Hat Products are not affected.
      - question: What is solution to fix vulnerability CVE-2024-7589 ?
        answer: >-
          There is no action required for CVE-2024-7589 as this vulnerability is specific to the FreeBSD distribution of OpenSSH. Red Hat Products are not affected.
