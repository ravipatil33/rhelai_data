  - context: >
      The vulnerability i.e. CVE-2023-48795 is also referred to as terrapin
      attack. This affects openssh packages on RHEL. A flaw was found in the SSH
      channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake,
      an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without
      causing a MAC failure.  The most significant identified impact is that it
      enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before
      authentication begins. No other observable impact on session.

          What is impact of CVE-2023-48795 or terrapin attack vulnerability on
          RHEL 9 system ?
        answer: >-
          The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to
          delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
          begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke
          timing obfuscation features. No impact for sessions.
      - question: What are mitigation steps for CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          You can disable affected ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8
          and RHEL-9. You can apply a subpolicy to disable CHACHA20-POLY1305
          cipher and set ssh_etm=0. This can be done using sub-policy in
          cryptographic policy. Detailed steps in CVE page.
      - question: ' Which package version includes fix for CVE-2023-48795 and CVE-2023-51385 ?'
        answer: >-
          Fix for CVE-2023-48795 and CVE-2023-51385 is included in openssh

          March 2024. For details on fix refer errata link
          https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1130.
      - question: What is the state of CVE-2023-48795 for openssh component ?
        answer: ' CVE-2023-48795 has state as ''Fixed'' with errata as RHSA-2024:1130. You are requested to apply this errata on the system using dnf command ''dnf update openssh*''.'
      - question: >-
          I have updated openssh package to latest available version but still
          my vulnerability scanner reporting as false positive ? Why ?
        answer: >-
          Red Hat takes a fix for a security flaw out of the most recent version
          of an upstream software package, and applies that fix to an older
          version of the package distributed by Red Hat. Avoid using upstream
          package version, only use Red Hat packages.
