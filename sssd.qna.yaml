      SSSD is an acronym for System Security Services Daemon. It is the client
      component of centralized identity management solutions such as FreeIPA,
      389 Directory Server, Microsoft Active Directory, OpenLDAP and other
      directory servers. The client serves and caches the information stored in
      the remote directory server and provides identity, authentication and
      authorization services to the host machine. SSSD provides two major
      features: obtaining information about LDAP users, authenticating LDAP user

      - question: What are the main features of sssd?
        answer: >-
          SSSD provides two major features - obtaining information about LDAP
          users and authenticating LDAP users.
      - question: Why do you need SSSD?
        answer: To leverage centralize authentication mechanism.
  - context: >-
      SSSD provides two major features - obtaining information about users and
      authenticating users. However, a successful authentication can only be
      performed when the information about a user can be retrieved, so if
      authentication doesn work in your case, please make sure you can at
      least obtain info from about the user with getent passwd $user and id.

          file.
      - question: How to troubleshoot sssd issue?
        answer: >-
          To troubleshoot sssd issues enable debugging persistently across SSSD
          service restarts, put the directive debug_level=N, where N typically
          stands for a number between 1 and 10 into the particular section.
      - question: Where sssd logs are getting stored?
        answer: ssd logs are stored inside /var/log/sssd

      Troubleshooting sssd start up issues. If you failed to start sssd process
      you need to start the sssd in debug mode. Typically `sssd -i d7` command
      will show you why sssd is failing to start. Some common causes where sssd
      can fail to start if the sssd.conf permission is not correct. Check the
      content of sssd.conf check if you have any typos in sssd.conf.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How to troubleshoot sssd start up issues?
        answer: >-
          Start sssd in debug mode `sssd -i d7` it will show you why sssd is
          failing to start
      - question: How can I validate sssd.conf
        answer: Use sssctl-config check.
      - question: Why sssd is failing to start
        answer: >-
          Start sssd in debug mode using `sssd -i d7` also, check the permission
          of sssd.conf it should be 600 and owned by root. You can use
          `journalctl -u sssd.service --no-pager` to check why sssd is failing
          to start.

      Troubleshooting LDAP user login issues using sssd. If you are failed to
      login with sssd first try to check if you can lookup the LDAP user using
      id ldapuser if it fails enable sssd debugging by adding debug_level =9
      under all section of the sssd.conf and restart sssd and reproduce the
      issue post reproducing the issue check /var/log/sssd. If the logins take
      too long or the time to execute id $username takes too long. First, make
      sure to understand what does id username do. Do you really care abou

          you can use ignore_group_member = false under the `[$domain]`
          section of sssd.conf Normally the most data-intensive operation is
          downloading the groups including their members.
      - question: id lookup takes long time for AD user.

          you can use `ignore_group_member = false` under the `[$domain]`
          section of sssd.conf Normally the most data-intensive operation is
          downloading the groups including their members.
      - question: What is the consequence of `ignore_group_members = true`
      
        answer: >-
          Setting the ignore_group_members option to True makes all groups
          appear as empty, thus downloading only information about the group
          objects themselves and not their members, providing a significant
          performance boost.

      Troubleshoot sssd failure or failed to start sssd involves several steps
      first try to start sssd in debug mode using `sssd -i d7`. Some comon issue
      related to sssd start up involves `krb5_kt_start_seq_get failed: Key table
      file /etc/krb5.keytab not found` which indicates the keytab file is
      absent. Check using `klist -kte` if you have the keytab file.
      `sssd.service: main process exited, code=exited, status=4/NOPERMISSION`
      indicates sssd is failing to start due to permission issues
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Unable to start sssd?
        answer: Try to start sssd in debug mode using `sssd -i d7`
      - question: krb5_kt_start_seq_get failed
        answer: >-
          krb5_kt_start_seq_get failed Key table file /etc/krb5.keytab not
          found` which indicates the keytab file is absent. Check using `klist
          -kte`
      - question: sssd.service main process exited status=4/NOPERMISSION
        answer: >-
          `sssd.service: main process exited, code=exited,
          status=4/NOPERMISSION` indicates sssd is failing to start due to
          permission issues check if you have proper permisison set on sssd.conf
          it should be owned by root and permission should be 600.

      Integrate a linux machine with Active Directory using `adcli` or `realmd`
      to integrate a Linux machine with AD the command is `realm join
      domain_name -U aduser`. If you are failing to integrate a linux machine
      with active directory then enable verbosity using `realm join domain_name
      -U aduser -vvv`. When troubleshooting AD join issues alternatively try
      using --membership-software=samba or adcli and compare which provides
      better error msg.
